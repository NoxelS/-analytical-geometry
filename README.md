### Features

### Get Started

To get started you have to clone the repo and start a [liveserver](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
After that you can simply play around with the features or add new functions to the logic. For that you have to edit the `geraden.js` file.
